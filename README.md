A coding challenge for Bottle Rocket

## Notes

- Desktop support combo: Ubuntu Linux OS, Chromium browser

- Mobile support combo: Android OS, Chrome browser

- I don't believe Redux or React-Router are necessary for this small app, but I used them to prove that I could.

- The "back arrow" img on the "detail view" comp header seems to be a different graphic than the one supplied in the zip file, which I believe goes to the "Web.png" comp file that the instructions say to ignore, so I used another one I found online that more closely resembles the one on the "detail view" comp file.

- As "Avenir Next" seems to be a non-free font and was not supplied in the zip file, I replaced it with the Google font "Nunito", Regular and Semi-Bold, per the recommendation from [this page](https://elementthree.com/blog/free-font-alternatives-to-designer-favorites/).

- Missing Parameters:
  - No height for the header
  - No size or placement for the header icons
  - No placement for the header text
  - I just placed them where I thought they were visually comparable to the supplied comp files and sized the header height and icons accordingly.
